# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
This is going to be a pretty empty page while the rest of the website gets filled up. The big picture goal is to be able to document my projects as I finish what will hopefully be the final year of my PhD. On a good day, hopefully it is useful to someone interested in continuum robots. On a bad day, it will be my little PhD baby, out in the world. 

The fact that I needed to establish the "Why" in the beginning of this obviously useless page points to my PhD training.
