<!-- # Breaking the curve with PCCA (Piecewise Constant Curvature Assumption) -->

#### Quick context setting :
This post can be thought of as a follow-up rabbit hole to a previous post written on the OpenCR blog, found [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jbk/opencontinuumrobotics/101/2023/01/06/howto-tdcr-modeling.html).  We will basically look at using a lumped parameterization using constant curvature arcs to model the backbone. 

<p style="color:grey">
- _Segment_ : Portion of the backbone (including disks, tendons and what have you nots) starting from the base till point of tendon termination. 
- _Subsegment_ : Portion of the backbone between two disks. Many subgsegments = 1 segment

- _TDCR_ : tendon-driven conitnuum robot
- _Lumped parameterization_ : Lumped parameterization discretizes the curve using geometrical assumption such that the curve can be represented by a finite number of parameters. 
- CC : Constant curvature arcs
- </p>.



As most students trying to model these robots, I was first introduced to the Constant curvature assumption. The premise is very simple - the entire segment is modeled as a constant cuvature arc. There is tonne of material on understanding this better - an extensive survey on different formalization routines [1], blog posts from the lab on introducing the forward kinematics ([link 1](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jbk/opencontinuumrobotics/101/2022/12/02/cc-kinematics.html) and [link 2](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jbk/opencontinuumrobotics/101/2022/12/09/tdcr-cc-model.html)). The underlying physical meaning is simple. From the Euler Bernoulli theorem we know that applied moment is directly proportional to the curvature. So constant curvature -> constant moment applied -> the TDCR effectively has a constant moment acting on it.

## Breaking the curve
To model these intermediate forces, the segment is now _broken_ into a series of constant curvature arcs, each representing a subsegment. So now, the backbone no longer has a constant curvature along its length, and can accomodate different forces that make it deviate from its C-shape. We call this the piecewise constant curvature assumption! The beauty of this representation is you can represent the curve discretely, and use the curvature components along the local _x_, _y_, and _z_ axes to represent not just bending, but also twist in the robot. {% include elements/button.html link="" text="Rabbit hole leading to modeling twists using CC arcs [to follow soon]" %},

## Questions and Inspiration

All the above raises a very pertinent question - 
{% include elements/highlight.html text="How much breaking is too much breaking ?" %}

There is an excellent excellent discussion on this discretization in [Dr. Gilbert's survey paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2021.732643/full) [2] that I would recommend reading (see page 5 for perspectives). Its obvious that the less number of arcs used to approximate, the less accurate the modeled curve. The errpr reduces as we increase the number of arcs. There is also a study on variation of accuracy with increasing number of arcs in the paper. (see figure 4).

Increasing the number of arcs also means an increase in the computational effort. And instead of only focusing on increasing the number of arcs, can we enforce constraints on the curvature variation of these arcs to reduce the computational complexity ? This question inspired our next work. If we had a very simple load at the tip (like from a camera or a hanging weight), could we get away by using a simple linear curvature approximation to model the robot ?
